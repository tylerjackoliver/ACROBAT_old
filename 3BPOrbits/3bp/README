Chapter 4. Orbits in the Planar Three-Body Problem

*---- Maple (Utilities)

reduce
	Writes an expression as a sum-of-squares

*---- Maple

K
	Computes the regularized Hamiltonian

three.mpl
three.mw
	Maple script and worksheet, generate the regularized
	equations. Reads the procedures defined in the files K
	and reduce

*---- MATLAB

K.m
	Computes the regularized Hamiltonian

f.m
	Differential equation in physical coordinates.
	Note that f.c is available to compile a MEX file
	with the same functionality - you can use the command
	mex f.c to get the MEX file.

threebp.m
	Differential equation in regularized coordinates
	Note that threebp.c is available to compile a MEX file
	with the same functionality - you can use the command
	mex threebp.c to get the MEX file.

gendata3.m
	Integrate the differential equations, and store
	the data in the file data3.mat. Note that the ode
	integrations may take some time. Hence we supply the 
	output of the integration of the regularized equations
	in the data file data3.mat. The data in data3.mat
	are used by figdata3.m for viewing the particle motion

figdata3.m
	View the results from data file data3.mat, which
	can be generated by gendata3.m
	The computation of the figure 4.6 is a computational
	expensive task and will take a lot of time. You can see
	the progress in the figure during the computation.

data3.mat
	Data of solution of differential equations, 
	generated by gendata3.m, used by figdata3.m
	
*---- C files (to compile MEX files)

f.c
threebp.c
	C files to compile MEX files, and replace the less
	efficient MATLAB files. See your local MATLAB 
	installation guide  on how to generate the MEX files
